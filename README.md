# full-stack-app
Example of a full stack app - REACT, node

# ToDo

- create a HomePage - add a field that shows the server state
- create an endpoint in the backend to supply data for field
- create Dockerfile for back/frontend and a top-level docker-compose file

## TL;DR

Just type `make`

## frontend

## backend
