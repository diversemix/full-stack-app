# Notes

Testing is all about knowing your boundaries.

What are your boundaries?


## router-defaults-to-404.spec.js

- Easiest test as we are not even going to the controller, as the url is wrong

## router-happy-path.spec.js

- This looks like a good test but what is wrong?

## router-happy-path-no-controller.spec.js

- So this has mocked the implementation
- But its a little tricky maybe it indicates something is wrong with the implementation?
- What could be better about the implementation of router?
- SOLID


** NOT talked about CAP **
